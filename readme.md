# Documentation
IronWriter represents moments or blocks of content in your stories as "events". How much content you choose to write into each card is up to you.

![alt text](/docs/images/events.gif)

There are two types of events - "fiction" and "meta". Functionally there is nothing different about them, but they are visually distinct to help separate your fictional elements from your meta actions during your session such as moves, question prompts, etc.

![alt text](/docs/images/mode-toggle.gif)

IronWriter uses special markup (referred to as "tags") to automatically update the character sheet. These tags are case-insensitive (`removeAsset` is the same as `removeasset`) and should always be wrapped in square brackets `[]`. This documentation will use capitalization for clarity and leave out the brackets for brevity.

![alt text](/docs/images/markup.gif)

> [health -2][momentum -1] Blood begins to pour out of the wounds on my arm as the wolf attempts to rip it off. I reach for my dagger tucked in my belt.

> I pull the dagger from its sheath and stab the wolf in its neck.[progress wolf] It finally release my arm and whimpers in pain. Just as I think I'm about to make it out of this alive, three more wolfs come running out of the forest. [progress "Wolf Pack" formidable]

_For a full example, see the [example session](/docs/sample.md)._

Tags contain parameters which are used to control how the tags change the character sheet or other event-based features like bookmarks. Parameters are separated by spaces, so if you want to include spaces wrap the parameter in double quotes e.g. `rename "Brynn Tahir"`. In the documentation, parameters that are wrapped in carets `<parameter>` are required and those wrapped in curly braces `{parameters}` are optional.

All events are stored in a history stack so that when you edit an event, any subsequent ones that are dependent on it will be replayed on top of your changes.

![alt text](/docs/images/history.gif)

IronWriter includes a bookmarking system to help you quickly traverse the history for noteworthy events. There are two types of bookmarks - those created by the system when you make/break a bond or make progress on a vow, and those you create yourself using the `bookmark` tag. Both types of bookmarks are saved between sessions and exist in exports.
