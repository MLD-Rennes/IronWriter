I sat on the beach watching the line of my fishing pole bob up and down. Then suddenly the line went taut as a fish attempted to run away with my bait.
```
```
Ask the Oracle (50/50): Yes
```
```
I grabbed the pole just before the fish drags it into the water. I fought with that fish for what felt like forever, but finally dragged it out of the ocean. [progress "Vow: Prove Fishing Skill"]

As I began to filet the fish, I hear a growl behind me. I slowly turn and find a wolf staring at me. [progress Wolf dangerous]

```
```
The wolf lunged at me and clamps down on my right arm with its powerful jaws.
```
```
2d10: [6, 6]
1d6: [1] + 3 health = 4
> Miss
```
```
[health -2][momentum -1] Blood begins to pour out of the wounds on my arm as the wolf attempts to rip it off. I reach for my dagger tucked in my belt.
```

2d10: [9, 8]
1d6: [6] + 2 iron = 8

```
```
Ask the Oracle (Generic Roll): 45
```
```
I pull the dagger from its sheath and stab the wolf in its neck.[progress wolf] It finally release my arm and whimpers in pain. Just as I think I'm about to make it out of this alive, three more wolfs come running out of the forest. [progress "Wolf Pack" formidable]

```
2d10: [9, 10]
1d6: [3] + 5 spirit = 8
> Miss
```
```
[spirit -2][momentum -1] I fear the the end is near. The three new wolves approach slowly while the wounded one hangs back with my dagger stuck in its neck.
```
```
2d10: [7, 10]
1d6: [3] + 3 health = 6

```
```
Ask the Oracle (Generic Roll): 3
```
```
The wolves all attack at once, each grabbing a different limb. [health -3][momentum -1] As I flail helplessly I know my time has come.
```
```
2d10: [7, 9]
1d6: [3] + 2 heart = 5
> Miss
```
```
Alas, death has always been inevitable.
